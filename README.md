# Infinite Workspace

This project is a fun demonstration of two things:
* How efficient the browser rendering architecture is now
* How easy Angular.js makes simple applications

The project was derived from angular-seed and still has lots of unfinished symphonies.
Testing this from a file:// url doesn't work.  The browser refuses to do certain things.
